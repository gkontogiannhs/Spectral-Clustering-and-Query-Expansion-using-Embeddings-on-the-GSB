    """
    Contextual Graphical Set-Based Window (ConGSBWindow) Information Retrieval Model.
    This model combines the features of the GSBWindow and the ConGSB model, by introducing 
    a windowed approach on the collection's terms and leveraging methods from ConGSB.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    collection : object
        The collection over which IR tasks will be performed.
        
    window : int or float
        The size of the window to consider while processing terms.
        - If an integer, it represents the number of terms.
        - If a float, it represents the proportion of terms in a document.
    
    clusters : int
        Number of clusters to be used for the union graph.

    cond : dict, optional (default={})
        Pruning conditions for the graph. Can specify conditions in the form {'edge': value} or {'sim': value}.

    Attributes:
    -----------
    model : str
        Name of the model.
    
    labels : ndarray
        Cluster labels for the nodes of the graph.
        
    embeddings : ndarray
        Embeddings corresponding to the nodes of the graph.
    
    graph : object
        The pruned union graph based on the windowed approach.
    
    prune_percentage : float
        Percentage of the graph that has been pruned.

    Methods:
    --------
    _model() -> str :
        Returns the class name of the model.
