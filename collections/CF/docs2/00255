absorption
of
two
antibacterial
drugs
cephalexin
and
co
trimoxazole
in
malabsorption
syndromes
plasma
concentrations
and
urinary
excretion
of
cephalexin
trimethoprim
and
co
trimoxazole
were
measured
in
normal
subjects
and
in
patients
with
coeliac
disease
small
bowel
diverticulosis
crohn
disease
cystic
fibrosis
cephalexin
only
and
after
administration
of
cholestyramine
the
absorption
of
cephalexin
was
improved
in
coeliac
disease
diverticulosis
and
cystic
fibrosis
in
crohn
disease
the
peak
plasma
level
was
reduced
and
delayed
the
absorption
of
both
trimethoprim
and
was
increased
in
all
three
conditions
however
there
was
increase
in
the
plasma
level
of
trimethoprim
in
coeliac
disease
and
diverticulosis
when
compared
with
that
of
in
crohn
disease
there
was
threefold
increase
in
the
peak
plasma
level
of
after
cholestyramine
administration
there
was
malabsorption
of
