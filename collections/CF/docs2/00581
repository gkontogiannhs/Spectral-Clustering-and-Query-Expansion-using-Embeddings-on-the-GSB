vitamin
in
this
review
we
make
deliberate
attempt
to
put
all
the
information
on
vitamin
requirement
absorption
metabolism
and
function
in
both
animals
and
man
in
better
perspective
the
large
clinical
trials
in
which
vitamin
was
given
at
pharmacological
levels
for
presumed
medical
indications
as
well
as
trials
of
vitamin
for
bona
fide
deficiency
disease
in
man
will
be
extensively
reviewed
nutritional
aspects
discussed
include
dietary
intake
biological
activity
the
evaluation
of
nutritional
status
and
the
relationship
to
dietary
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
metabolism
concerns
include
absorption
transport
and
deposition
and
cellular
function
clinical
aspects
include
deficiency
states
