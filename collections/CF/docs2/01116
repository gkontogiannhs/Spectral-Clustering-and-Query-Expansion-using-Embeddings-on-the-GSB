aortic
lesions
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
have
fat
malabsorption
providing
an
experimental
model
for
evaluation
of
the
hypothesis
that
low
fat
intake
may
prevent
atherosclerosis
we
studied
the
frequency
and
extent
of
aortic
precursor
lesions
fatty
streaks
early
lesions
late
lesions
found
at
autopsy
in
this
disease
as
well
as
in
other
patients
with
debilitating
disorders
but
with
no
apparent
impairment
of
fat
absorption
fatty
streaks
were
less
common
in
the
cystic
fibrosis
group
as
were
the
late
lesions
there
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
frequency
length
or
thickness
of
the
early
lesions
the
findings
suggest
that
fat
may
be
responsible
for
progression
but
not
initiation
of
the
precursor
lesions
and
support
the
concept
that
early
restriction
of
dietary
fat
may
prevent
delay
or
otherwise
modify
atherosclerosis
in
the
adult
