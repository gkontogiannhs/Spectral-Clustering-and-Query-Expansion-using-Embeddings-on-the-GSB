improvement
on
the
safety
of
sweat
test
equipment
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
have
higher
concentration
of
sodium
and
chloride
in
their
sweat
than
normals
this
observation
led
to
the
introduction
of
an
iontophoresis
technique
for
stimulating
the
sweat
glands
with
pilocarpine
occasionally
electrical
burns
result
from
defective
equipment
or
from
an
incorrect
or
badly
applied
test
procedure
new
design
of
equipment
is
presented
which
eliminates
the
possibility
of
burn
during
the
test
