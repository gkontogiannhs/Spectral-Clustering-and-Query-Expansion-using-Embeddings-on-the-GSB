we
have
measured
fast

components
of
haemoglobin
fmh
in
nine
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
without
any
clinical
evidence
of
diabetes

the
nine
patients
with
cystic

fmh
of
which
differed
significantly
from
controls
with

fmh
of
there
was
no
correlation
between
fmh
and
age
or
fmh
and
duration
of
disease
the
above
results
raise
the
question
as
to
what
extent
the
fmh
is
reflection
of
hyperglycaemia
or
insulinopenia
