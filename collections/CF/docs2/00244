retrospective
study

lung
symptoms
and

of

the

fourteen

simple

for

were
developed
when

were
more

comparing

it
was

that

the

it
was

that

than

more

the
proportion
of
female
patients
in
class
iii
was
greater
than
in
the
other
two
classes
but
this
could
not
explain
the
differences
because
of
the
small
number
of
patients
in

the
differences
between

are
more
doubtful
than
the

between
