enterokinase
and
trypsin
activities
in
pancreatic
insufficiency
and
diseases
of
the
small
intestine
the
of
enterokinase
and
trypsin
activities
were
investigated
in
infants
and
children
with
variety
of
and
pancreatic
disorders
fourteen
patients
with
diarrhea
and
grade
ii
mucosal
injury
revealed
significant
less
than
reduction
of
enterokinase
trypsin
and
disaccharidase
activites
as
compared
to
children
with
normal
mucosa
nine
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
pancreatic
insufficiency
had
normal
mucosal
enterokinase
activity
and
elevated
intraluminal
enterokinase
activity
with
very
low
or
no
trypsin
activity
patients
with
hypoproteinemia
and
protein
loss
associated
with
intestinal
patients
and
intestinal
lymphoid
nodular
hyperplasia
patients
had
normal
or
insignificant
decrease
of
enterokinase
and
trypsin
activities
in
patients
with
steatorrhea
normal
sweat
test
normal
intestinal
mucosa
and
absent
trypsin
activity
two
entities
were
defined
one
group
patients
was
diagnosed
as
schwachman
diamond
syndrome
with
pancreatic
insufficiency
and
normal
mucosal
and
intraluminal
enterokinase
activity
the
second
group
patients
with
absent
mucosal
and
intraluminal
enterokinase
activity
and
normal
lipase
and
amylase
activities
was
diagnosed
as
congenital
enterokinase
deficiency
