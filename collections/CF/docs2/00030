muscular
performance
and
vitamin
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
have
tocopherol
deficiency
presumably
as
result
of
steatorrhoea
evidence
for
possible
muscular
involvement
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
is
clinical
muscular
weakness
and
wasting
in
many
patients
biochemical
creatinuria
on
creatine
poor
diet
with
reversal
of
this
finding
after
ingestion
of
tocopherol
esters
accompanied
by
decrease
in
creatine
in
plasma
and
an
increase
in
creatine
in
muscle
and
pathological
focal
lesions
in
skeletal
muscle
resembling
nutritional
muscular
dystrophy
and
ceroid
pigment
in
smooth
muscle
muscle
strength
was
measured
with
bulb
ergograph
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
attending
the
clinics
at
the
babies
hospital
columbia
presbyterian
medical
center
new
york
in
double
blind
study
in
which
half
the
cases
received
tocopherol
orally
and
the
remainder
placebo
no
significant
increase
in
muscle
strength
was
found
in
those
patients
receiving
tocopherol
over
period
of
months
as
compared
to
the
placebo
group
blood
tocopherol
levels
in
the
treated
group
returned
to
