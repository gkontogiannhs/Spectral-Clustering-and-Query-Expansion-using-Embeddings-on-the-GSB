in
children
clinical
pathological
correlation
the
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
determine
the
frequency
and
etioloical
factors
of
neuroaxonal
dystrophy
in
brainstem
and
spinal
cord
of
children
with
various
non
neurological
diseases
the
materials
used
in
this
study
consisted
of
consecutive
autopsies
from
and
an
additional
cases
from
previous
years
by
far
the
most
common
cause
of
in
children
was
drugs
particularly
vincristine
used
for
the
treatment
of
malignant
tumors
approximately
of
these
children
developed
and
the
changes
ranged
from
mild
to
severe
approximately
two
thirds
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
congestive
heart
failure
and
chronic
renal
failure
developed
and
the
changes
were
mostly
mild
only
one
third
of
patients
with
congenital
biliary
atresia
and
malnutrition
developed
and
the
changes
were
always
mild
the
frequency
and
severity
of
increased
in
patients
who
had
prolonged
clinical
courses
no
was
seen
in
patients
who
died
from
acute
cases
such
as
trauma
acute
infection
intoxication
acute
renal
failure
or
prematurity
this
type
of
may
be
considered
as
reactive
to
wide
variety
of
injurious
factors
such
as
drug
toxicity
malnutrition
chronic
hypoxia
and
chronic
renal
failure
either
alone
or
in
combination
in
contrast
to
previous
reports
of
low
incidence
of
in
children
there
has
been
sharp
increase
in
recent
years
due
to
the
advent
of
chemotherapy
