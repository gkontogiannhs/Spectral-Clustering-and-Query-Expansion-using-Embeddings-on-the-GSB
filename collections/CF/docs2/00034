cystic
fibrosis
and
coeliac
disease
the
coexistence
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
coeliac
disease
has
recently
been
reported
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
cystic
fibrosis
may
predispose
to
the
later
development
of
coeliac
disease
the
diagnosis
of
coeliac
disease
is
largely
dependent
upon
the
demonstration
of
histological
changes
in
the
small
intestine
but
jejunal
biopsy
may
be
distressing
to
small
child
it
is
suggested
that
food
protein
antibody
studies
may
be
of
value
in
the
investigation
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
in
whom
gluten
sensitivity
is
suspected
in
the
following
case
the
decision
to
perform
jejunal
biopsy
was
made
when
these
studies
were
positive
food
protein
antibody
to
cereal
antigens
wheat
oatmeal
and
gluten
and
to
ruminant
antigens
cow
milk
and
calf
serum
were
persistently
detected
in
the
patient
blood
jejunal
biopsy
showed
partial
villous
atrophy
with
shortening
broadening
and
branching
of
the
villi
there
was
satisfactory
clinical
improvement
after
gluten
restriction
