in
cystic

cystic
fibrosis
is
characterised
by
low
serum
levels
of
essential
fatty
acids
however
the
fatty
acid
pattern
does
not
totally
resemble
that
of
dietary
deficiency
the
differences
suggest
reduction
in
the
desaturation
of
it
is
not
known
whether
this
defect
is
the
primary
lesion
in
or
is
the
result
of
tissue
damage
in
the
disease
it
is
proposed
that
patients
might
have
increased
linoleic
acid
requirements
and
possibly
specific
requirements
for
its
desaturation
products
