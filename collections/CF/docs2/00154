defects
in
the
cell
cycle
of
fibroblasts
obtained
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
this
paper
analyzes
the
cell
cycle
of
cystic
fibrosis
derived
fibroblasts
and
statistically
demonstrates
their
failure
to
support
normal
population
doubling
time
in
vitro
and
indicates
that
this
is
due
largely
to
failure
of
the
cystic
fibrosis
derived
cells
to
enter
the
cell
cycle
in
normal
numbers
we
have
no
explanation
for
the
significant
difference
in
the
behavior
of
these
cells
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
vis
vis
either
normal
or
disease
control
fibroblasts
save
to
conclude
that
it
proceeds
from
an
intrinsic
property
of
the
cells
themselves
