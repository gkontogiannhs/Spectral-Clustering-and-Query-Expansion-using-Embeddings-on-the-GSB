high
breast
milk
sodium
in
cystic
fibrosis
letter
increased
sodium
concentration
in
sweat
is
characteristic
of
cystic
fibrosis
however
we
have
read
nothing
on
the
sodium
content
of
breast
milk
in
this
condition
patient
with
sweat
test
proved
cystic
fibrosis
with
mild
pulmonary
disease
had
her
first
baby
by
normal
delivery
at
term
samples
of
breast
milk
were
obtained
on
the
sixth
and
seventh
days
post
partum
when
the
mother
was
not
breast
feeding
the
two
sodium
concentrations
were
and
mmol
concentrations
much
higher
than
in
any
other
milk
sample
tested
at
this
hospital
in
large
survey
and
higher
than
any
we
have
seen
in
the
literature
milk
of
such
high
sodium
content
would
be
unsafe
for
baby
and
we
suggest
that
if
mothers
with
cystic
fibrosis
were
to
breast
feed
the
sodium
of
the
mild
should
be
measured
first
the
breast
like
so
many
other
exocrine
glands
seems
to
be
affected
by
the
secretory
abnormalities
of
cystic
fibrosis
