electrophoretic
separation
detection
and
variation
of
amylase
isoenzymes
an
electrophoretic
technique
for
demonstrating
amylase
isoenzymes
is
described
after
separation
in
an
agarose
gel
containing
linear
polyacrylamide
polymer
to
reduce
flow
the
amylase
fractions
are
visualized
by
incubation
with
commercially
available
dye
starch
polymer
phadebas
amylase
test
the
technique
detects
amylase
fractions
with
activities
below
some
characteristic
changes
in
such
diseases
as
acute
and
chronic
pancreatitis
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
macroamylasemia
and
inherited
variants
as
well
as
after
maxillofacial
surgery
are
mentioned
