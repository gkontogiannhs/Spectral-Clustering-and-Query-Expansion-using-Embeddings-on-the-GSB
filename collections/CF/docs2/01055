activity
of
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
and
relationship
to
cystic
fibrosis
enzyme
activity
against
hippuryl
arginine
was
studied
in
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
from
controls
and
cystic
fibrosis
patients
the
enzyme
had
lysosomal
distribution
and
an
acid
optimum
of
ph
with
little
or
no
activity
present
above
ph
dithiothreitol
was
required
for
full
activity
and
the
kinetics
of
thiol
activation
were
different
for
the
control
and
cystic
fibrosis
enzyme
the
properties
and
lysosomal
distribution
of
the
enzyme
indicated
that
it
was

the
fall
and
rise
in
activity
with
subculture
the
cyclical
pattern
of
activity
through
serial
passage
and
the
level
of

were
similar
for
the
control
and
cystic
