components
in
cystic

freshly
obtained
sera
were
assayed
from
young
adult
patients
age
men
and
women
and
from
control
patients
with
bronchiectasis
or
chronic
bronchitis
in
whom
had
been
ruled
out
in
addition
the
blood
from
mothers
heterozygotes
of
patients
was
assayed
the
mean
level
in
the
men
was
slightly
lower
than
that
in
the
male
controls
whereas
the
women
had
significantly
higher
mean
level
of
than
did
the
female
controls
the
level
in
the
women
was
also
significantly
higher
than
that
of
the
men
by
the
student
test
the
female
controls
had
slightly
higher
levels
than
did
the
male
controls
but
this
difference
was
not
significant
comparison
of
levels
from
all
of
the
subjects
to
the
controls
shows
considerable
overlap
in
values
especially
in
the
men
these
studies
suggest
that
an
assay
of
serum
does
not
effectively
distinguish
subjects
from
patients
with
other
types
of
chronic
lung
disease
however
the
differences
between
women
and
men
is
interesting
and
deserves
further
attention
our
data
from
young
adults
do
not
fully
confirm
those
reported
by
conover
et
al
but
it
is
possible
that
the
experimental
effects
of
observed
by
conover
might
result
from
action
of
the
enzyme
on
the
factor
of
serum
although
its
identity
most
likely
is
