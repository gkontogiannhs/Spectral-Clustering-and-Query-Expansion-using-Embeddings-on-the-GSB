screening
for

by
analysis
of
meconium
for
albumin
and
protease
inhibitors
qualitative
method
of
detecting
elevated
meconium
protein
concentration
was
compared
with
method
of
determining
meconium
albumin
concentration
by
since
elevated
meconium
protein
levels
can
indicate
pancreatic
insufficiency
caused
by
cystic

between

per
healthy
infants
passed
meconium
specimens
that
gave
false
positive
reaction
with
the
boehringer
mannheim
test
strip
and
contained
greater
than
expected
concentration
of
albumin
it
was
possible
to
exclude
pancreatic
insufficiency
in
all
of
these
children
by
determining
the
ratio
albumin
alpha
antitrypsin
in
meconium
and
subsequent
faecal
specimens
since
it
was
found
that
values
of
this
ratio
in
excess
of
suggested
pancreatic
insufficiency
of
the
type
associated
with
cystic
fibrosis
three
of
neonates
with
subsequently
proven
cystic
fibrosis
yielded
meconium
specimens
giving
negative
test
strip
results
and
low
albumin
concentrations
in
two
of
these
patients
the
ratio
albumin
alpha
antitrypsin
in
the
meconium
was
within
normal
limits
but
within
two
months
of
birth
the
albumin
alpha
antitrypsin
ratio
in
the
faeces
of
both
children
was
greater
than
