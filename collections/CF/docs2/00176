relationship
between

mucoid
strains
from
the

the
simultaneously

nm
variants
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
frequently
observed
in
cultures
from
the
respiratory

of
chronically
infected
cystic

patients
have
been
studied
cultures
in

were
unstable
and
easily
dissociated
nm
colonies
in
large
proportion
of
the
cases
and
nm
variants
occurring
simultaneously
in
cultures
from
one
and
the
same
clinical
specimen
were
of
the
same
pyocine
type
phage
type
and
serogroup
in
some
remaining
cases
there
were
small
differences
between
the
and
nm
variants
such
that
identity
between
the
variants
from
one
and
the
same
specimen
was
possible
although
not
definite
the
nm
dissociants
from
strains
were
of
the

of
