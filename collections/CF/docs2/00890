demonstration
by
sera
from
patients
with
cystic

and
two
pediatric
patients
being
treated
for
chronic
pulmonary
infections
not
related
to
cystic

and
six
sera
or
serum
pools
from
uninfected
individuals
were
tested
with
microtiter
for
reactivity
against
exotoxin
and
two
proteases
from
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
exotoxin
was
purified
from
low
protease
strain
of
aeruginosa
and
shown
to
have
adenosine
diphosphate
ribose
transferase
activity
and
mouse
lethality
proteases
were
purified
from
an
isolate
of
aeruginosa
from
patient
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
had
proteolytic
activity
against
elastin
and
collagen
in

assay

substrates
the
antibody
responses
of
the

detected
using

were
correlated

expressed
as
the
ratio
of

cpm
in

serum
to
the

in
the

inverse
correlations
were
found
between
these

for

and
clinical

highest
ratios
occurred
in

showing
the
lowest

these
results
confirm
that
proteases
and
exotoxin
of

are
produced
in
cystic

pulmonary
infections
due
to

and
suggest
that
they
may
serve
