alpha
fucosidase
from
two
cystic

livers
has
been
purified
and
characterized
purification
was
accomplished
by
an
affinity
chromatographic
procedure
previously
used
for
normal
liver
alpha
fucosidase
of
the
two
cystic
fibrosis
alpha
fucosidases
indicated
that
they
were
very
similar
to
normal
liver
alpha
fucosidase
with
regard
to
ph

km
subunit
structure
and
antigenicity
however
gas
liquid
chromatographic
analysis
revealed
altered
carbohydrate
compositions
for
both
the
cystic

alpha
fucosidases
the
three
major
sugars
found
in
normal

alpha

mannose
