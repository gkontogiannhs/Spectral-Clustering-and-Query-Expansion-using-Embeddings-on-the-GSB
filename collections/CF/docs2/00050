failure
of
lavage
in
cystic
fibrosis
in
an
attempt
to
retard
deterioration
of
pulmonary
function
young
man
with
cystic
fibrosis
underwent
broncho
pulmonary
lavage
of
an
entire
lung
in
spite
of
theoretical
advantages
the
lavage
produced
an
acute
deterioration
in
the
patient
clinical
and
physiologic
status
from
which
he
had
not
recovered
one
month
later
we
conclude
that
lavage
in
cystic
fibrosis
may
be
hazardous
and
should
be
reserved
for
those
cases
in
which
conventional
methods
of
improving
clearance
have
failed
