immune
complexes
in
cystic
fibrosis
circulating
immune
complexes
were
detected
in
serum
and
sputum
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
there
were
extensive
deposits
of
immunoglobulins
and
complement
immune
complexes
in
several
of
the
organs
especially
the
respiratory
and
tracts
but
not
in
the
kidneys
significant
concentrations
of
igg
and
of
complement
complexes
could
be
eluted
from
the
lungs
of
the
patients
but
not
from
those
of
controls
studies
involving
autoradiography
and
molecular
sieving
through
sephadex
columns
identified
both
bovine
serum
albumin
and
staphylococcal
alpha
haemolysin
as
two
of
the
antigens
present
in
the
immune
complexes
the
sedimentation
constant
of
the
immune
complexes
was
about
to
the
clinical
significance
of
these
immune
complexes
and
the
wide
variety
of
antibodies
detected
in
patients
are
discussed
