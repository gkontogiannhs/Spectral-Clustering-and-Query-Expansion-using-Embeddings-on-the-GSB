we
studied
the
clinical

laboratory
characteristics
of
seven
patients
with
sweat

concentration
consistently
between

meq
liter
each
has
chronic

all
lack

laboratory
findings
indicate
the
preservation
of

the
patients
include
two

five
children
in
one
family
and
two
of
four
in
another
in

one

one

results

the

for
this

these
