comparative
pathology
of
marine
invertebrates
and
the
study
of
human
disease
studies
on
an
infection
with
gram
negative
bacteria
in
limulus
led
to
the
discovery
of
the
extreme
sensitivity
of
the
amebocytes
to
gram
negative
endotoxin
this
led
to
the
development
of
method
for
measuring
very
small
amounts
of
endotoxin
in
biologic
fluids
and
in
human
blood
yet
had
the
original
observation
of
cantacuzene
on
the
large
common
edible
spider
crab
been
followed
this
remarkable
sensitivity
of
marine
arthropod
blood
to
endotoxin
would
have
been
recognized
much
earlier
the
original
work
of
metchnikoff
on
sea
star
larvae
stimulated
him
to
develop
the
major
theory
of
phagocytosis
but
until
the
adult
animal
of
the
same
genus
was
re
examined
half
century
later
the
presence
of
powerful
substance
which
selectively
inhibits
growth
of
lymphocytes
following
primary
immunization
remained
unknown
though
mucus
secretion
is
fundamental
characteristic
of
most
invertebrate
phyla
and
all
vertebrates
little
is
known
about
the
regulatory
mechanism
of
the
secretory
process
studies
of
the
responses
of
specialized
invertebrate
secretory
cells
to
infection
have
now
led
to
new
means
of
studying
macromolecular
control
of
mucus
secretion
in
man
these
three
stories
emphasize
the
continuing
need
to
study
disease
as
biologic
phenomenon
