the
majority
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
were
found
to
be
carriers
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
none
of
them
however
carried
aeruginosa
in
their
nares
in
contrast
none
of
the
non
cf
family
members
of
the
patients
with
cf
were
carriers
of
aeruginosa
for
example
only
of
cultures
from
skin
throat
and
nares
of
the
family
members
were
positive
for
aeruginosa
isolations
of
aeruginosa
from
the
same
cf
patients
were
often
of
the
same
pyocine
type
no
specific
pyocine
type
of
aeruginosa
was
predominant
in
patients
with
cf
isolations
of
aeruginosa
from
siblings
with
cf
may
or
may
not
be
of
the
same
pyocine
type
as
that
of

proband
