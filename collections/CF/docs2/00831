the
specific

beta

beta
fucosidase
acid
and
alkaline
phosphatase
were
studied
in
meconium
from
infants
with

cf
and
control
subjects
the
study
revealed
significant
variations
in
the
specific
activity
of
the
enzymes
except
for
acid
phosphatase
the
variations
were
not
uniform
the
activities
of

beta

and
alkaline

were
markedly
decreased

while
the
activity
of
beta
fucosidase
was
significantly
increased
less
than
in
meconium
from

with

it
is
suggested
that
the
decreased
activity
of
alpha
mannosidase
and
beta
glucuronidase
might
contribute
to
the
accumulation
of
the
abnormal
substances
in

meconium
the
highly
increased
activity
of
beta
fucosidase
raises
the
possibility
of
an
additional
or
alternative
method
for

using
meconium
as
the
test
material
