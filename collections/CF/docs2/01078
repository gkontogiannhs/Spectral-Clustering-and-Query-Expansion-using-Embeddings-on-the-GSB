the
bacteriological
effect

chemotherapy
against
mucoid
strains
of
pseudominas
aeruginosa
in
the
lower
respiratory
tract
of
patients
with

is
reported
comparison
of
the
effect
of
high
doses
of
tobramycin
mg
kg
given
alone
or
in

with
carbenicillin
showed
significant
difference
in

of
the
combination
therapy
in
of
the
initially
successful
courses
the
patients

recolonized
within
one

fifty
three
patients
were
examined
by
audiometric

only
in

it

that

treatment
it
is
concluded
that
high

tobramycin
treatment
in
children

adolescents
with
normal

implies
only
minimal
