incidence
course
and
outcome
of
portal
systemic
hunting
fifteen
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
seen
over
an
year
period
developed
clinical
hepatic
disease
in
patients
all
symptoms
were
secondary
to
portal
hypertension
ten
had
hypersplenism
and
had
variceal
bleeding
including
who
developed
both
conditions
all
patients
who
survived
the
initial
episode
of
bleeding
underwent
portal
systemic
shunting
shunting
procedure
also
was
performed
on
patients
with
hypersplenism
but
no
variceal
bleeding
no
subsequent
deterioration
of
intellectual
function
occurred
in
either
the
shunted
or
unshunted
patients
only
of
the
shunted
patients
showed
progression
of
hepatic
disease
after
surgery
these
results
suggest
that
portal
systemic
shunting
is
useful
in
the
treatment
of
bleeding
esophageal

sweat
test
to
rule
out
cystic

should
be
included
in
the
evaluation
of
any
teenage
or
young
