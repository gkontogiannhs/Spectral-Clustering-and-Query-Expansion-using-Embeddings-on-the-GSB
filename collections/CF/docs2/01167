the
effect
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
non
cystic
fibrosis
plasma
on
responses
in
isolated
frog
gastric
mucosa
an
alternative
method
for
assaying
the
cystic
fibrosis
factor
could
be
on
the
responses
of
isolated
living
tissues
the
ability
of
the
frog
gastric
mucosa
to
secrete
hydrochloric
acid
and
maintain
negative
potential
difference
is
well
known
this
potential
difference
across
the
secretory
mucosa
to
the
nutrient
serosa
side
coupled
with
its
property
of
transporting
chloride
and
hydrogen
ions
against
an
electrochemical
gradient
could
therefore
serve
as
useful
model
for
investigating
any
induced
changes
in
the
presence
of
cf
and
non
cf
plasma
from
the
results
obtained
the
short
circuit
current
and
secretion
responses
in
the
presence
of
cf
whole
plasma
show
significant
increases
compared
to
the
control
these
findings
show
that
in
the
presence
of
cf
plasma
whole
or
plasma
fraction
there
is
marked
increase
in
the
actively
transported
cl
and
the
effect
of
cf
plasma
in
increasing
net
cl
flux
is
important
considering
the
elevation
of
this
electrolyte
in
the
sweat
of
cf
patients
and
deserved
further
investigation
