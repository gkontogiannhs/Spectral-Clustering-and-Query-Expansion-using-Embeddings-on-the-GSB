cystic
fibrosis
detection
of
heterozygotes
we
have
developed
new
technique
for
detecting
cystic
fibrosis
and
the
heterozygote
of
the
assay
can
be
done
by
any
laboratory
having
an
aggregometer
for
measuring
platelet
aggregation
quantitation
of
the
results
is
obtained
by
comparing
the
transmittance
recorded
when
only
is
added
to
platelet
rich
plasma
in
patients
and
known
heterozygotes
this
ratio
is
times
higher
than
in
healthy
subjects
we
have
tested
from
healthy
people
patients
with
and
known
heterozygotes
we
could
detect
all
patients
and
of
the
known
heterozygotes
