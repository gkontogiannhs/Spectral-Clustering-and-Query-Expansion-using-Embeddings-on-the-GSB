human
respiratory
tract
secretion
mucous
glycoproteins
of
nonpurulent
secretions
and
sputum
of
patients
with
bronchitis
and
cystic
fibrosis
mucous
glycoproteins
were
isolated
by
agarose
gel
filtration
from
nonpurulent
secretions
and
purulent
sputum
which
had
been
reduced
and
in
the
case
of
purulent
secretions
treated
with
the
solubilized
and
purified
glycoproteins
were
fractioned
on
cellulose
into
two
major
ii
and
two
minor
ia
iii
blood
group
active
components
components
and
ii
had
similar
carbohydrate
and
amino
acid
compositions
which
were
typical
for
human
blood
group
substances
these
two
components
did
differ
in
several
respects
component
contained
sulfate
and
did
not
inhibit
influenza
virus
while
component
ii
contained
sulfate
and
was
potent
inhibitor
of
virus
component
ii
also
migrated
more
rapidly
on
sodium
dodecyl
sulfate
acrylamide
gel
electrophoresis
components
and
ii
in
purulent
secretions
displayed
only
minor
compositional
differences
from
their
counterparts
in
nonpurulent
secretions
component
ii
was
more
abundant
in
two
sputum
samples
from
subjects
with
cystic
fibrosis
than
in
purulent
bronchitic
secretions
or
in
nonpurulent
secretions
