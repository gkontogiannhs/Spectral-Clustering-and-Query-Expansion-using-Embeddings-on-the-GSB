concurrently
the

to
be

sephadex

indicated
that

that
the

removed

this

afforded

however
also
generated

subsequent

determined
to

fraction
was
also
found

and
therefore
is
not
specific
cda
fraction
ii
iv
is
thought
to
represent
cf
specific
cda
mw
since
it
could
not
be
demonstrated
in
either
normal

was

bio

provided
fold

respectively
concurrent
analysis
of

for
cda
by

for

by

showed
cfp
only
in

isoelectric

and
edta
treatment
of
active

immunoglobulin
ig
and
sephadex
column
fractions
followed
by
bio
gel
chromatography
provided
evidence
that
cfp
was
associated
with
the
cf

it
is
unknown
as
yet
whether
cfp
itself
is
responsible
for
the
cf
