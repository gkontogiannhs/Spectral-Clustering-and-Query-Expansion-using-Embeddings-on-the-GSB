sera

lymphocyte
culture
media
derived
from
cystic
fibrosis
cf
affected
and
carrier
subjects
contain
ciliary
dyskinesia
factor
cdf
detected
by
our
rabbit
tracheal
bioassay
in
addition
we
also
find
cdf
in
fibroblast
media
from
these
same
donors
and
in
amniotic
fluid
cell
media
derived
from
cf
carrier
or
affected
fetuses
in
these
latter
instances
the
media
were
inactive
in
the
bioassay
but
became
active
when
mixed
with
purified
igg
in
all
instances
cdf
activity
was
eliminated
by
the
addition
of
anti
igg
we
have
separated
low
molecular
weight
fraction
between
and
from
cf
sera
and
culture
media
which
is
inactive
in
the
bioassay
until
igg
is
added
presumptive
and
indirect
evidence
indicates
that
this
fraction
behaves
similarly
to
the
complement
derived
anaphylatoxin
in
addition
we
have
found
activity
in
sera
from
cf
patients
and
to
lesser
extent
carriers
that
induces
degranulation
of
cytochalasin
treated
human
leukocytes
since
this
activity
appears
to
be
in
different
molecular
species
from
that
containing
cdf
we
postulate
that
the
primary
defect
in
cf
is
the
deficiency
of
an
enzyme
whose
substrates
include
family
of
membrane
active
molecules
