mucus
secretion
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
by
epithelial
tissues
from
cystic
fibrosis
and
control
subjects
this
paper
reviews
some
of
our
efforts
to
compare
mucous
glycoproteins
from
the
tract
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
with
those
of
control
subjects
we
have
used
secretions
from
several
sources
including
sputum
bronchial
washings
obtained
with
the
aid
of
the
fiberoptic
bronchoscope
aspirates
through
endotracheal
or
tracheostomy
tubes
and
finally
secretions
discharged
by
human
epithelial
explants
solubilization
and
fractionation
of
secretions
properties
of
the
major
mucous
glycoprotein
components
composition
of
major
components
from
non
infected
bronchitic
and
cf
lungs
and
organ
culture
of
human
epithelium
are
discussed
