uptake
of
heparin
by
lymphocytes
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
in
danes
and
bearn
proposed
that
the
metachromasia
noted
in
short
term
white
blood
cell
cultures
from
both
cystic
fibrosis
homozygotes
and
heterozygotes
probably
reflected
uptake
of
heparin
from
the
culture
medium
by
pinocytosis
and
not
as
in
the
genetic
stored
this
hypothesis
was
recently
confirmed
by
robertson
et
al
using
heparin
they
demonstrated
an
increased
uptake
of
heparin
in
short
term
white
blood
cell
cultures
which
corresponded
to
the
observations
made
on
the
basis
of
staining
however
as
mentioned
in
by
bafalluy
et
al
any
white
blood
cell
in
culture
can
be
overloaded
with
heparin
as
the
processes
involved
in
endocytosis
and
exocytosis
probably
are
inconstant
within
one
cell
and
certainly
in
different
cell
types
standardisation
of
cytoplasmic
retention
of
heparin
may
not
be
possible
in
order
to
eliminate
the
partial
overlap
between
normals
homozygotes
and
obligatory
heterozygotes
observed
by
robertson
et
al
this
report
on
heparin
again
raised
the
question
of
the
significance
of
cellular
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
relevance
of
in
the
cultured
cell
is
still
unclear
between
and
the
content
of
the
cultured
fibroblast
was
reported
as
normal
and
variable
