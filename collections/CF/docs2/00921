exocrine
gland
function
and
the
basic
biochemical
defect
in
cystic
fibrosis
biochemical
link
is
proposed
between
secretion
and
reabsorption
in
exocrine
glands
in
the
form
of
factor
kinin
which
initiates
ion
reabsorption
activation
of
this
factor
involves
arginine
esterases
and
in
cystic
fibrosis
these
may
be
defective
preventing
the
formation
of
kinin
in
cystic
fibrosis
stimulation
of
exocrine
glands
produces
abnormal
reabsorption
of
ions
leading
to
the
physiological
abnormalities
and
clinical
manifestations
of
the
disease
