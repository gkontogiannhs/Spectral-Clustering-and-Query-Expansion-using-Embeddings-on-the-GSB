the
retrograde
perfusion
assay
in
the
rat
parotid
gland
was
used
to
investigate
the
effects
of
salivary
secretions
from
control
and
reserpine
treated
rats
on
na
reabsorption
results
demonstrated
that
submaxillary
saliva
from
the
treated
animals
caused
inhibition
of
na
reabsorption
accompanied
by
reduction
in
the
volume
of
saliva
secreted
and
reduction
in
flow
rate
by
contrast
submaxillary
saliva
from
control
rats
caused
inhibition
of
na

reduction
in

parotid

from

also
inhibited

parotid

only
inhibited

the

of
na
reabsorption
and
the
reduction
in
salivary
volume
and
flow
rates
caused
by
submaxillary
saliva
of
reserpine
treated
rats
were
either
abolished
or
significantly
reduced
when
the
saliva
was
previously
heated
to
degrees
frozen
and
then
thawed
or
kept
in
glass
tubes
at

these
results
indicate
that
saliva
from
reserpine
treated
rats
have
comparable
effects
in
this
assay
system
to
those
of
saliva
from

further
support
its
use
as
