cystic
fibrosis
heterozygosity
in
pathogenesis
of
allergy
the
article
by
dr
warner
and
colleagues
may
be
of
great
significance
to
our
understanding
of
the
aetiology
and
pathogenesis
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
accords
with
our
observations
that
allergic
symptoms
and
positive
skin
tests
are
more
common
in
homozygotes
than
in
healthy
controls
apart
from
the
fact
that
of
our
homozygotes
gave
positive
skin
test
to
one
or
more
of
different
classes
of
bencard
antigens
the
main
one
being
aspergillus
fumigatus
at
least
of
the
heterozygotes
had
strong
positive
history
of
allergy
of
which
the
mother
and
her
maternal
progenitors
followed
by
the
siblings
accounted
for
most
further
studies
are
required
to
establish
the
relationship
if
any
between
the
gene
responsible
for
the
allergic
manifestation
in
the
population
and
the
phenotype
