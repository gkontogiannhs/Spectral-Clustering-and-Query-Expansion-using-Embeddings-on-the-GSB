sulphate
incorporation
of
leucocytes
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
in
preliminary
studies
of
short
term
leukocyte
cultures
using
na
so
incorporation
into
cetyl
pyridinium
chloride
precipitable
material
presumably
we
have
found
significant
variation
among
patients
and
their
parents
obligate
heterozygotes
this
biochemical
heterogeneity
is
comparable
to
what
has
been
reported
in
fibroblast
cultures
and
serum
the
amount
of
na
so
incorporated
into
material
found
in
both
the
incubation
medium
and
the
cells
from
patients
is
significantly
increased
over
normals
similar
analysis
between
normals
and
heterozygotes
shows
no
significant
difference
in
na
so
incorporation
into
material
of
the
cells
however
out
of
heterozygotes
appeared
to
show
pattern
of
increased
incorporation
into
material
found
in
the
incubation
medium
indicated
by
higher
mean
than
the
normal
donors
these
results
suggest
yet
another
system
to
study
the
effects
of
the
gene
the
incorporation
of
na
so
into
material
of
leukocyte
cultures
gives
additional
evidence
for
the
genetic
heterogeneity
in
this
disorder
