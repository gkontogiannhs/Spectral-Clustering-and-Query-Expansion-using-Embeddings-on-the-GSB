the
possibility
that
the

the
two
drugs
may
be
additive
was
investigated
by
assessing
their
combined
effects
on
glandular

salivary

protein
in
the

submaxillary
gland
individually
their
effects
were
also
assessed
in

isoproterenol

administered
in

reserpine
in

this

resulted

with

concentrations
after

of
isoproterenol
this
type

also
reduced
the

produced
vacuolization
in

the
secretion

these
elevated

were
however

obtained
after

stimulation
the
secretion

these
findings
indicate
that
both
ipr

reserpine
have

significant

that
their

the

this
synergism
for
