relevance
of
second
messengers
in
cystic
fibrosis
water
electrolyte
and
macromolecular
secretion
which
is
affected
in
cystic
fibrosis
is
regulated
by
of
the
autonomic
nervous
system
stimulating
the
cells
by
binding
to
alpha
adrenergic
beta
adrenergic
and
cholinergic
receptors
therefore
genetic
disturbance
in
cyclic
adenosine
monophosphate
amp
response
could
eventually
explain
some
of
the
manifold
expressions
of
labile
biochemical
changes
observed
in
cf
specially
in
tissue
culture
we
further
characterized
beta
receptors
in
cultured
fibroblasts
of
cf
patients
and
normal
controls
and
investigated
isoproterenol
and
prostaglandin
mediated
amp
response
using
defined
culture
conditions
no
significant
difference
was
found
between
the
two
phenotypes
on
basal
amp
values
with
the
exception
of
one
cell
line
cf
strains
had
to
increased
amp
content
this
difference
is
highly
significant
this
statistically
significant
difference
in
response
can
neither
be
attributed
to
differences
in
dose
or
time
response
curves
nor
to
differential
amp
escape
into
culture
medium
since
cf
cells
synthesize
more
amp
than
controls
only
in
response
to
isoproterenol
but
not
to
prostaglandin
the
alteration
which
might
be
responsible
for
the
observed
phenomenon
is
probably
located
proximal
of
the
adenylate
cyclase
at
the
cells
border
between
intra
and
extracellular
space
