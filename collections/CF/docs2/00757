hemoglobin
oxygen
equilibrium
in
cystic
fibrosis
study
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
demonstrated
that
increasing
severity
of
pulmonary
involvement
was
associated
with
mild
but
definite
increase
in
erythrocyte
dpg
and
decrease
in
hemoglobin
affinity
for
oxygen
the
predominant
regulators
of
dpg
were
blood
ph
cardiac
output
and
systemic
oxygen
transport
no
significant
relationship
was
observed
between
erythrocyte
dpg
content
and
arterial
oxygen
tension
may
have
prevented
greater
increase
in
erythrocyte
dpg
content
the
inadequate
increase
in
dpg
and
consequent
insufficient
change
in
hemoglobin
oxygen
affinity
coupled
with
an
insufficient
compensatory
erythrocytic
response
may
adversely
affect
tissue
oxygenation
in
patients
with
severe
cystic
fibrosis
