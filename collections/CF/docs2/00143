comprehensive
study

rrna
methylation
in
human
fibroblasts
is
presented
cells
from
normal
volunteers
and
patients
with
cystic

cf
were
examined
during
exponential
growth
by
incubation
with
methyl
methionine
and
uridine
the
ratio
of
to
counts
per
minute
in
isolated
rna
serves
as
measure
of
the
extent
of
methylation
and
was
found
to
be
similar
in

the

methylation
of

is
qualitatively

normal

to
