limitations
of
diagnostic
value
of
the
sweat
test
the
sweat
test
even
if
carried
out
by
an
experienced
technician
sometimes
lacks
reproducibility
owing
presumably
to
physiological
variations
patient
diet
temperature
and
other
factors
at
present
unrecognized
some
patients
are
particularly
prone
to
exhibit
this
variability
and
in
them
single
sweat
test
is
almost
valueless
the
aldosterone
status
is
believed
to
be
responsible
for
reciprocal
relationship
between
sweat
sodium
and
potassium
concentrations
tests
done
on
patients
show
that
high
sweat
potassium
is
associated
with
correspondingly
lower
sodium
circumstance
which
must
be
borne
in
mind
when
interpreting
patient
sweat
sodium
of
patients
presenting
with
variety
of
symptoms
compatible
with
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
with
sweat
sodium
ranging
from
to
meq
mmol
only
have
proved
to
have
cystic
fibrosis
after
several
years
of
observations
have
later
been
diagnosed
as
having
asthma
the
problem
of
the
grey
area
of
uncertainty
is
aggravated
by
the
heterozygous
state
which
is
also
associated
with
sweat
sodium
in
this
range
repeated
sweat
tests
are
indicated
if
the
sweat
sodium
lies
within
the
grey
area
and
the
diagnostic
importance
accorded
the
test
should
diminish
as
the
sodium
value
approaches
this
area
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
must
remain
in
doubt
unless
there
is
strong
supportive
clinical
evidence
