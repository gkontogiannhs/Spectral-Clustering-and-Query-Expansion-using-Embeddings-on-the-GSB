lectins
and
cystic
fibrosis
letter
dr
freed
and
dr
buckley
have
shown
that
lectin
concanavalin
con
causes
severe
rhinitis
sinusitis
and
increased
mucus
secretion
when
inhaled
by
man
or
small
intestinal
colic
foul
smelling
flatus
and
mucus
coated
stools
if
ingested
it
is
somewhat
surprising
that
the
authors
suggest
that
suitable
inhaled
or
ingested
lectin
may
be
useful
in
treating
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
since
the
very
symptoms
produced
by
the
ingested
lectin
resemble
those
associated
with
the
disease
more
attractive
recommendation
would
be
for
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
to
avoid
substances
containing
lectins
such
as
con
to
avoid
stimulating
additional
mucus
release
the
underlying
pathogenetic
defect
in
cystic
fibrosis
may
be
inappropriate
excessive
stimuli
by
lectin
like
substances
these
observations
suggest
that
the
increase
in
the
protein
content
of
lymphocytes
is
stimulated
by
plasma
factor
present
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
in
carriers
of
the
cystic
fibrosis
gene
these
observations
plus
those
of
freed
and
buckley
might
suggest
that
cystic
fibrosis
is
disease
involving
plasma
factor
with
lectin
or
con
like
activity
which
stimulates
the
secretion
of
mucus
and
increases
the
enzyme
content
of
circulating
or
cultured
lymphocytes
professor
lieberman
confuses
cause
with
effect
if
there
is
excessive
mucus
production
in
cystic
fibrosis
we
suggest
that
this
is
because
the
secretion
is
so
difficult
to
remove
from
the
mucosal
surface
goblet
cells
and
mucus
glands
become
clogged
with
hyperviscid
mucus
which
not
being
removed
stimulates
further
mucus
production
to
deprive
the
patient
of
the
mucotractive
value
of
his
dietary
lectins
would
be
therapeutic
mischief
equivalent
to
prescribing
cough
suppresant
for
productive
cough
