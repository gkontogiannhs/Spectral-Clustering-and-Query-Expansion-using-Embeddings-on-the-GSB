nine
patients
with
cystic

but
without
digital
clubbing
group
were
matched
prospectively
by
sex
and
approximate
age
to
cystic
fibrosis
patients
with
digital
clubbing
group
and
to
normal
persons
control
subjects
patients
in
group
had
significantly
less
than
lower
clinical
scores
and
forced
vital
capacity
than
did
those
in
group
indicating
more
severe
pulmonary
disease
in
the
former
however
other
spirometer
tests
of
pulmonary
function
revealed
no
differences
between
groups
and
the
degree
of
digital
clubbing
had
significant
less
than
linear
relationships
to
forced
vital
capacity
and
clinical
scores
for
groups
and
plasma

of
prostaglandins
alpha
and
were
significantly
increased

group

compared

group
however
plasma

of
prostaglandin
keto

were
not
different
in
groups

these
studies
suggest
that
the
degree
of
digital
clubbing
in
cystic

is
related
to
the
severity

that
the
