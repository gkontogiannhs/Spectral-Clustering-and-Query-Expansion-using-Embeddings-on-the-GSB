abnormal

decreased
activity
in
serum
the
activity
of
alpha
fucosidase
is
decreased
in
the
serum
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
when
compared
to
age
matched
controls
this
result
combined
with
the
elevated
activity
in
skin
fibroblasts
supports
the
concept
of
an
abnormal
intracellular
and
extracellular
distribution
of
alpha
fucosidase
in
cystic
fibrosis
