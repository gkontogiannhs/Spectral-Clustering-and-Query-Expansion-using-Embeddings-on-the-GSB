analysis
of
serum
protein
in

faecal
specimens
from

free
of
cystic
fibrosis
cf
and
from
infants
with
the
disease
were
analysed
for
albumin
and
alpha
antitrypsin
content
faeces
from
infants
with
no
cf
had
mean
albumin
content
of
less
than
mg
dry
weight

mean
albumin
alpha
antitrypsin
ratio
value
of
less
than
faeces
from
infants
with
cf
had
with
one
exception
an
albumin
content
of
more
than
mg
dry
weight

ratio
value
greater
than
it
was
subsequently
found
that
the
duodenal
aspirate
from
the
child
with

whose
faeces
had
low
albumin
content

had
tryptic
activity

at
much
reduced
level
