glycine
conjugates
of
cholic
deoxycholic
and
lithocholic
acids
by
in
variety
of
pediatric
hepatobiliary
disorders
showed
elevations
in
neonatal
hepatitis
syndromes
cholestasis
and
hepatitis
of
extrahepatic
or
intrahepatic
origin
measurements
of
individual
serum
bile
acids
failed
to
differentiate
between
the
various
neonatal
hepatitis
syndromes
in
one
patient
with
cholestasis
the
increased
levels
of
bile
acids
observed
returned
to
normal
following
therapy
with
cholestyramine
and
phenobarbital
in
chronic
active
hepatitis
the
serum
bile
acid
values
correlated
well
with
the
bilirubin
and
sgot
in
response
to
therapy
with
corticosteroids
these
data
confirm
suggestions
that
serum
cholylglycine
and
levels
are
sensitive
indicator
of
disturbed
hepatic
function
and
can
be
used
in
monitoring
the

activity
and
therapeutic
response
in
various
hepatitis
syndromes
in
reye
syndrome
and
protracted
diarrhea
of

elevations
in
serum

were
detected
without
associated

provided
additional

of
