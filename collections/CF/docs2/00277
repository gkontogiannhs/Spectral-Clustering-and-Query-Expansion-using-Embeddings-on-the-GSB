detection
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
heterozygotes
during
the
past
year
we
have
developed
new
assay
for
cystic
fibrosis
by
utilising
the
ussing
chamber
technique
and
measuring
the
electrical
properties
of
rat
jejunum
in
the
presence
of
the
sera
to
be
tested
the
potential
difference
and
resistance
are
measured
with
sensitive
electrometer
at
minute
intervals
over
minutes
we
were
able
to
detect
of
the
heterozygotes
the
possibility
of
detecting
the
remaining
is
present
and
can
we
feel
be
achieved
by
using
more
concentrated
specimen
