heterogeneity
of
the
carbohydrate
chains
of
sulfated
bronchial
glycoproteins
isolated
from
patient
suffering
from
cystic
fibrosis
sulfated
glycoproteins
having
blood
group
activity
were
isolated
from
the
sputum
of
child
suffering
from
cystic
fibrosis
by
reduction
of
the
fibrillar
mucus
chromatography
on
ecteola
cellulose
and
gel
filtration
on
sepharose
the
sulfated
glycoproteins
were
degraded
with
alkaline
borohydride
and
the
degradation
products
were
fractionated
by
chromatography
on
ion
exchange
resins
and
by
gel
filtration
the
carbohydrate
chains
thus
obtained
have
wide
heterogeneity
with
regard
to
acidity
and
molecular
size
the
neutral
chains
contain
blood
group
active
and
incomplete
chains
as
short
as
residue
of
acetamido
deoxy
galactose
the
minimal
size
of
the
neuraminic
acid
containing
chains
is
less
than
that
of
the
sulfated
chains
which
increases
with
the
degree
of
sulfation
the
