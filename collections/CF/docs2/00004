methodological
study
of
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
by
instrumental
neutron
activation
analysis
of
sodium
in
nail
clippings
instrumental
neutron
activation
analysis
inaa
of
nail
clippings
was
used
in
the
development
of
diagnostic
method
for
cystic
fibrosis
cf
from
cf
patients
and
controls
more
than
three
years
old
nail
clippings
were
sampled
for
tests
of
different
errors
as
result
of
this
study
precise
collection
routine
was
outlined
sodium
is
easily
washed
out
from
nail
clippings
the
risk
of
sodium
contamination
of
the
nails
seems
to
be
small
the
sodium
distribution
in
the
nail
is
inhomogeneous
and
the
sodium
content
varies
also
from
nail
to
nail
in
the
same
person
there
is
good
evidence
that
the
increased
sodium
in
the
nails
of
cf
patients
comes
from
the
sweat
there
seems
to
be
basic
intrinsic
sodium
level
which
is
about
the
same
in
the
nails
of
cf
patients
as
in
controls
the
precision
and
accuracy
of
inaa
for
determining
sodium
in
nails
is
considered
satisfactory
it
is
concluded
that
inaa
of
the
sodium
concentration
in
nail
clippings
is
suitable
method
as
an
aid
in
the
diagnosis
of
cf
if
precise
collection
routine
is
used
