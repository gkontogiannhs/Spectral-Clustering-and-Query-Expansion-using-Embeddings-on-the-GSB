fatal
disease
cystic
fibrosis
is
an
intricate
vexatious
disease
involving
the
whole
patient
as
yet
we
are
only
able
to
treat
the
signs
and
symptoms
and
this
should
be
done
as
completely
as
possible
treatment
is
geared
at
eradicating
the
staphylococcus
aureus
from
the
lung
and
preventing
reinfection
gram
negative
organisms
particularly
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
are
treated
when
they
become
pathogenic
other
conditions
such
as
atopia
of
the
respiratory
tract
or

may
be
detrimental
to
the

condition
and
must
be

requires
adequate
enzyme
replacement
therapy
to
prevent
steatorrhea
and
azotorrhea
if
fatty
acids
play
role
in
membrane
oxygen
transport
then
their
abnormal
composition
in
cystic

may
require
specific
changes
in
the
type
of
fat
intake
salt
depletion
should
be
looked
for
and
corrected
screening

is
needed
