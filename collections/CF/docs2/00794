zinc
status
and
the
retinol
transport
system
were
examined
in
retinol
supplemented
cystic
fibrosis
cf
patients
and
age
matched
controls
plasma
vitamin
was
significantly
lower
in
the
cf
group
as
compared
to
the
controls
and
correlated
positively
with
plasma
retinol
binding
protein
rbp
in
both
the
cf
and
control
groups
plasma
zinc
of
the
cf
group
was
not
significantly
lower
than
controls

hair
zinc
was
plasma
zinc
was
positively
correlated
with
plasma

vitamin
and
albumin
in
the
cf
group

not
in
the

plasma
concentrations
of
vitamin
rbp
albumin
and
zinc
decreased
with
age
in
the

but
not
in
the

the
data
support
previous
suggestions
that
low
plasma
vitamin
levels
in
cf
are
due
to
defects
in
the
retinol
transport
system
the
zinc
status
of
the
cf
groups
as
whole
was
judged
to
be
low
normal
however
subgroup
of
cf
patients
were
in
the
marginal
to
deficient
category
this
subgroup
also
had
lower
levels
of
plasma
vitamin
and
rbp
the
data
suggest
that
zinc
may
be
contributing
factor
in
the
low
plasma
vitamin
rbp
levels
of
cf
patients
with
marginal
or
deficient
zinc
status
