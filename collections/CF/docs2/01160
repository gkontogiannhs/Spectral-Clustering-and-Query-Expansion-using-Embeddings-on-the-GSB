operational
definition
of
cystic
fibrosis
recently
one
of
us
suggested
new
hypothesis
concerning
the
basic
defect
of
cystic
fibrosis
the
purpose
of
the
present
paper
is
to
review
this
model
and
to
critically
discuss
its
eventual
diagnostic
applications
with
extensive
studies
we
collected
experimental
data
which
contribute
five
major
arguments
in
favour
of
the
proposition
that
cf
may
be
an
enzyme
recognition
site
mutant
with
fibroblast
cultures
the
three
genotypes
can
be
separated
in
the
following
way
cf
homozygote
leaky
for
alkaline
phosphatase
and
lysosomal
hydrolases
is
tamm
horsfall
glycoprotein
thp
inducible
cf
heterozygote
leaky
for
and
lysosomal
hydrolases
is
not
thp
inducible
normal
control
not
leaky
for
and
lysosomal
enzymes
is
not
thp
inducible
with
the
exception
of
second
double
blind
study
the
thp
induction
as
well
as
the
leakage
analysis
seem
to
be
statistically
unequivocal
they
strongly
support
our
hypothesis
concerning
the
basic
defect
in
cf
