complement
in

lieberman
reported
that
there
was
considerable
overlap
in
quantitative
levels
between
all
of
the
subjects
tested
and
the
control
group
his
control
group
however
was
composed
of
subjects
with
bronchiectasis
or
chronic
bronchitis
in
whom
had
been
ruled
out
the
use
of
more
proper
control
group
by
lieberman
either
in
place
of
or
in
parallel
with
his
diseased
control
groups
would
have
provided
more
meaningful
interpretation
concerning
the
role
of
complement
in
cystic
fibrosis
we
agree
that
there
is
tendency
for
to
be
higher
in
females
than
in
males
although
lieberman
was
quick
to
dispel
any
notion
of
being
implicated
in
the
aetiology
of
he
overlooked
the
one
facet
of
our
initial
study
that
still
makes
our
hypothesis
feasible
raised

obligate
heterozygotes
hann
et
al
reported
that
serum
was
raised
in
both
patients
and
their
parents
our
initial
data
on
levels
by
radial
immunodiffusion
and
haemolytic
studies
do
not
confirm
this
finding
we
are
supporting
the
hypothesis
that
is
either
complement
caused
or
complement
mediated
disorder
in
which
like
molecule
bradykinin
either
alone
or
by
complexing
with
igg
gives
rise
to
the
physiological
and
pathological
state
