cystic
fibrosis
in
may
herrick
and
thompson
questioned
the
classical
hypothesis
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
suggested
that
children
are
in
fact
abnormally
susceptible
fo
any
respiratory
pathogen
from
birth
it
is
perhaps
bit
premature
to
change
the
classical
hypothesis
for
the
bacteriology
of
since
the
predominant
flora
of
hospital
nurseries
is
not
now
staph
aureus
but
rather
gram
negative
bacteria
it
may
be
that
the
initial
exposure
of
patients
is
to
an
organism
other
than
staph
aureus
in
addition
other
organisms
are
becoming
as
resistant
to
antibodies
as
ps
aeruginosa
so
other
organisms
could
perhaps
be
present
in
terminal
sputum
flora
which
agrees
with
our
data
