aid
to
physiotherapy
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
force
of
impact
and
frequency
of
percussion
by
and
parents
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
were
analysed
on
special
test
rig
and
incorporated
in
prototype
percussor
in
adult
volunteers
and
cadavers
maximum
intrathoracic
pressure
could
be
achieved
by
critical
frequency
of
mechanical
percussion
which
was
higher
than
that
reached
by
and
parents
consequently
the
percussor
was
redesigned
to
operate
at
this
optimum
frequency
it
was
then
discovered
that
if
the
percussor
was
pressed
firmly
enough
against
the
chest
this
maximum
intrathoracic
pressure
could
be
indicated
by
quivering
of
the
voice
in
continuing
study
of
intrathoracic
pressures
obtained
mechanically
and
manually
the
salford
percussor
produced
higher
pressures
than
the
and
maintained
them
constantly
while
the
efforts
and
results
varied
from
one
to
another
hospital
and
domiciliary
use
of
the
percussor
have
shown
it
to
help
in
the
first
stage
of
the
physiotherapy
routine
for
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
percussor
should
enable
adolescents
and
adults
to
treat
themselves
and
encourage
twice
daily
and
more
effective
chest
treatments
it
is
easy
to
apply
and
its
speed
and
efficiency
should
enable
parents
to
improve
the
quality
of
their
chest
therapy
for
younger
children
at
home
its
long
term
benefits
are
difficult
to
assess
because
of
the
nature
of
the
disease
