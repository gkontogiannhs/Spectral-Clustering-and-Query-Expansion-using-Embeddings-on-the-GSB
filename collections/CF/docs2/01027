alpha
fucosidase
novel
technique
has
been
employed
to
demonstrate
that
alpha
fucosidase
purified
from
cystic
fibrosis
and
control
livers
exhibits
differential
binding
to
the
lectin
concanavalin
the
concentration
of
alpha
ch
mannoside
necessary
to
prevent
binding
of
alpha
fucosidase
to
concanavalin
is
considerably
lower
for
the
cystic
fibrosis
enzyme
vs
mm
comparable
results
were
found
when
binding
studies
were
done
on
crude
supernatant
alpha
fucosidase
from
cystic
fibrosis
and
control
livers
plus
or
minus
mm
and
plus
or
minus
respectively
without
any
overlap
of
values
between
the
cystic
fibrosis
and
control
livers
these
results
suggest
that
comparative
lectin
binding
studies
on
cystic
fibrosis
and
normal
glycoproteins
from
readily
available
tissues
might
result
in
an
assay
for
detecting
the
cystic
fibrosis
genotype
