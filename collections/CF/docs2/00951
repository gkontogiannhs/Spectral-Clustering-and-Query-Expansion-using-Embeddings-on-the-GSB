protease
activity
in
cultivated
human
skin
fibroblasts
has
been
quantitated
using
mugb
an
active
site
titrant
of
trypsin
like
proteases
the
reaction
of
the
proteases
with
mugb
was
complete
in
hr
inhibited
both
by
benzamidine
and
nitrophenyl
but
not
by
the
extent
of
reaction
was
proportional
to
protein
concentration
and
independent
of
mugb

these

derived

when

these

are

our
earlier
suggestion
that
decreased

be
generalized
