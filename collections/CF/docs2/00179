investigation
of
the
occurrence
of
protein
and
some
other
properties
of
recently
isolated
strains
in
relation
to
the
occurrence
of
precipitating
antibodies
during
the
recent
decade
isolates
of
staphylococcus
aureus
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
have
been
tested
for
antibiotic
sensitivity
and
half
of
the
isolates
have
been
phage
typed
all
the
patients
were
followed
in
one
clinic
and
the
policy
of
antibiotic
treatment
was
consistent
during
this
period
the
results
show
dynamic
situation
where
epidemic
phage
types
during
recent
years
have
been
gradually
replaced
by
other
types
and
during
the
same
period
the
prevalence
of
strains
resistant
to
more
than
one
antibiotic
decreased
multiresistant
strains
including
strains
resistant
to
methicillin
were
infrequent
in
these
patients
from
per
cent
of
the
patients
the
same
strains
were
repeatedly
isolated
for
more
than
year
despite
an
apparently
successful
chemotherapy
recently
isolated
strains
were
found
to
produce
cellbound
as
well
as
extracellular
protein
ninety
one
per
cent
of
the
strains
produced
extracellular
lipase
and
only
per
cent
were
resistant
to
mercury
chloride
eighty
one
per
cent
of
the
patients
produced
precipitating
antibodies
against
aureus
as
judged
by
crossed
the
investigated
properties
of
aureus
were
not
significantly
correlated
with
the
occurrence
of
precipitating
antibodies
against
these
bacteria
the
possible
significance
of
protein
in
the
pathology
of
the

infection
is
discussed
