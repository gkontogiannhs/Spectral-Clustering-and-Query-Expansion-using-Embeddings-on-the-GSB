the

the

on
the

tca
in
the
distal

also
studied
the

glycine
taurine
conjugate
ratios
and
percentage
of
dihydroxy

salts
in
the

the

duodenal

both
quantitatively

qualitatively
normal

mmol
bsa

ra
mmol
had
no
inhibitory
effect
on
the
ileal
absorption
of

these
results
show
pronounced
abnormalities
of
duodenal
juice
bile
salts
in
cf
with
pancreatic
insufficiency
consistent
with
broken
enterohepatic
circulation
ehc
such
abnormalities
may
contribute
to
defective
lipid
absorption
in

the
data
in
the
experimental
animal
do
not
support
the
suggestion
that
unhydrolysed
dietary
substrates
play
role
in
the
pathophysiology
of
