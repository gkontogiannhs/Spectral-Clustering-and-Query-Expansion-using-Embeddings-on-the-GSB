ige
antibody
production
to
exoenzymes
and
common
antigen
oep
of
aeruginosa
was
studied
in
mice
that
were
injected
with
the
antigens
incorporated
into
water
in
oil
in
water
emulsion
or
al
oh
gel
oep
and
protease
toxoid
pt
elicited
ige
antibody
response
but
elastase
toxoid
et
did
not
capacity
of
the
oep
to
produce
ige
antibody
was
reduced
remarkably
by
it
protease
treatment
which
suggested
that
the
capacity
lies
in
the
protein
portion
of
oep
the
emulsion
was
less
effective
than
al
oh
gel
in
adjuvanticity
to
elicit
ige
antibody
response
but
the
emulsion
enhanced
the
igm
and
or
igg
antibody
response
to
pt
and
maintained
constant
level
for
long
period
these
findings
may
suggest
that
ige
antibody
response
to
some
components
of
aeruginosa
could
be
induced
in
man
high
serum
level
of
ige
was
observed
in
some
cases
of
cystic
fibrosis
caused
by
aeruginosa
infection
although
the
ige
antibody
activity
has
not
yet
been
determined
