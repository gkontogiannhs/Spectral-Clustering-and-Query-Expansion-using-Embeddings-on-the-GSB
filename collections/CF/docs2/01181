bioavailability
of
oral
antibiotics
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
present
investigation
was
designed
to
assess
the
absorption
and
disposition
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
of
two
commonly
used
antibiotics
an
aminopenicillin
epicillin
and
cephalexin
ospexin
the
pharmacokinetic
parameters
of
epicillin
in
patients
with
cf
and
their
normal
controls
differ
in
number
of
aspects
the
difference
found
in
the
maximal
plasma
concentrations
could
be
accounted
for
by
manifold
increase
in
the
renal
clearance
of
the
drug
our
data
support
the
idea
that
patients
with
cf
exhibit
an
unusually
large
and
rapid
renal
clearance
of
certain
penicillins
