retrospective
analysis
of
oral
xylose
tolerance
tests
in
pediatric
patients
was
performed
significant
difference
was
found
between
normal
subjects
and
untreated
children
with
celiac
disease
one

the
one

value
was
found
to
be
more
reliable
than
was
fecal

of

value
in

subjects
forty
eight
children
with
cystic

had
one

xylose
levels
within
the
normal
range
but
the

at

exceeded
significantly
less
than
those
of
the
controls
in
nonceliac
group
of

with

levels
almost
all
were

to

this
study
shows
that
single
estimation
of
xylose
in
blood
one

is
reliable
index
of
small

it
is
