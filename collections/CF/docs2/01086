phenotypic
of
pseudomonas

from
single
sputum
samples
of
typical

patients
indicated
high
frequency
of
heterogeneity
among
isolates
on
the
basis
of
differences
in
antibiotic
resistance
colony
morphology
pigmentation
and
serotype
two
or
more
isolates
with
different

stable

carnecillin
gentamycin
streptomycin
tetracycline
chloramphenicol

trimethoprim

these

more
frequently

believed
alternatively
phenotypically
distinct
strains
from

might
arise
as
phenotypic
dissociants
from
single

strain
because
of
the
frequency
and
multiplicity
of
phenotypically
distinct

isolates
which
we
obtained
from
our
cystic

patients
it
is
important
to
select
multiple
isolates
from
sputum
cultures
for
antimicrobial
susceptibility
testing
so
as
to
assess
adequately
the
susceptibility
of
this
organism
to
antibiotic
therapy
in
cystic

we
recommend
that
several
colonies
of
each
distinguishable

of

be
pooled
for
the
antibiogram
