cystic
fibrosis
and
myocardial
fibrosis
letter
we
were
interested
in
the
case
reported
by
mukherji
et
al
which
suggested
that
cystic
fibrosis
might
be
an
acid
we
have
seen
similar
child
aged
years
he
was
admitted
to
hospital
with
pneumonia
in
spite
of
conventional
treatment
with
cloxacillin
and
colistin
he
collapsed
and
died
hours
after
admission
the
heart
was
not
enlarged
but
the
myocardium
showed
grossly
abnormal
appearance
with
variations
in
thickness
and
extensive
areas
of
firm
pale
tissue
histology
of
the
heart
muscle
showed
very
dramatic
changes
with
severe
replacement
fibrosis
distributed
patchily
through
the
myocardium
this
similar
mixture
of
neutral
and
acid
was
shown
in
both
the
pancreas
and
the
salivary
glands
there
have
now
been
number
of
reports
of
myocardial
fibrosis
complicating
cystic
fibrosis
the
case
reported
by
mukherji
et
al
and
this
case
are
the
first
in
which
deposits
have
been
found
in
the
myocardium
the
mixture
of
neutral
and
acid
in
our
case
does
not
support
the
hypothesis
that
cystic
fibrosis
is
simply
genetic
acid
