letter
we
have
studied
seven
patients
with
and
ten
normal
children
and
have
confirmed
the
low
levels
of
both
in
plasma
and
in
red
cell
membrane
in
the
group
we
would
like
to
report
here
preliminary
results
on
the
fatty
acid
pattern
of
the
lecithin
fraction
of
bronchial
mucus
in
the
same
group
of
patients
and
controls
content
of
palmitic
acid
was
lower
and
that
of
oleic
acid
was
higher
in
the
patients
than
in
normal
children
this
abnormality
in
the
fatty
acid
composition
of
the
lecithin
of
the
mucus
could
be
an
important
finding
in
relation
to
the
respiratory
symptoms
in
some
experimental
work
supports
this
hypothesis
