prenatal
detection
of
genetic
defects
the
intrauterine
detection
of
genetic
disorders
represents
one
of
the
exciting
advances
in
medicine
the
major
emphasis
in
this
chapter
will
be
detailed
review
of
the
newer
approaches
toward
antenatal
detection
of
congenital
malformations
and
as
well
as
an
overview
of
the
experience
and
problems
of
antenatal
detection
for
chromosomal
aberrations
and
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
approaches
to
prenatal
diagnosis
of
genetic
disorders
include
amniocentesis
visualization
of
the
fetus
and
fetal
blood
sampling
prenatal
detection
of
genetic
disorders
has
become
reality
the
area
is
evolving
so
rapidly
that
the
major
indications
for
intrauterine
diagnosis
have
substantially
changed
within
the
past
year
prior
to
this
time
maternal
age
previous
down
syndrome
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
and
linked
recessive
disorders
were
the
primary
criteria
with
approximately
of
the
cases
being
used
for
cytogenetic
analysis
within
the
past
year
in
number
of
laboratories
about
half
of
the
referrals
for
amniocentesis
have
been
for
central
nervous
system
defects
certainly
with
the
development
of
technics
for
fetal
blood
sampling
this
distribution
of
the
frequencies
of
indication
may
once
again
change
substantially
most
probably
for
the
next
few
years
cytogenetic
abnormalities
and
neural
tube
defects
will
be
the
most
common
indications
for
amniocentesis
amniocentesis
will
continue
to
be
offered
to
many
patients
with
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
and
probably
will
be
available
for
monitoring
of
and
other
disorders
of
fetal
blood
as
well
as
for
accurate
knowledge
of
the
health
of
the
fetus
