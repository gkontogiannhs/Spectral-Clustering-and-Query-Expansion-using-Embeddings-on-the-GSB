method
for
estimating
heparin
binding
capacity
of
human
serum
is
described
when
human
serum
is
diluted
with
low
ionic
strength
heparin
containing
buffer
at
ph
protein
heparin
electrostatic
complexes
form
in
solution
with
subsequent
formation
of
insoluble
aggregates
which
can
be
collected
by
centrifugation
quantitative
determination
of
the
relative
amounts
by
weight
of
protein
and
heparin
in
the
insoluble
heparin
protein
aggregates
permits
estimation
of
combining
ratio
at
which
serum
proteins
bind
with
heparin
to
precipitate
from
solution
this
weight
combining
ratio
of
protein
and
heparin
is
quantitative
measure
of
the
total
affinity
for
heparin
of
all
proteins
in
serum
which
bind
heparin
at
ph
to
form
an
insoluble
complex
an
unusually
high
affinity
for
heparin
by
an
abnormal
serum
protein
or
an
increase
in
amount
of
normally
occuring
high
heparin
affinity
serum
protein
would
alter
the
average
protein
heparin
combining
ratio
and
increase
the
heparin
binding
capacity
of
human
serum
the
converse
would
be
true
for
serum
proteins
having
low
affinity
for
heparin
lowering
the
heparin
binding
capacity
of
human
serum
the
described
method
was
used
to
evaluate
the
heparin
binding
capacity
of
serum
proteins
in
normal
individuals
and
in
persons
with
cystic
fibrosis
