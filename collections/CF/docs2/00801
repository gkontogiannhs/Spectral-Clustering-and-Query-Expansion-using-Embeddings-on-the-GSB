fetal
cystic
fibrosis
presenting
as
dystocia
due
to
midgut
volvulus
with
lethal
perforation
fetal
or
neonatal
volvulus
is
rare
event
and
is
usually
associated
with
an
anatomic
defect
massive
abdominal
distension
secondary
to
ruptured
or
unruptured
volvulus
has
never
been
reported
as
cause
of
obstructed
labor
the
present
report
documents
such
case
secondary
to
chemical
peritonitis
resulting
from
ruptured
midgut
volvulus
this
case
demonstrates
an
unusual
presentation
of
presumed
cystic
fibrosis
with
meconium
ileus
and
volvulus
which
led
to
ischemic
infarction
and
perforation
of
the
small
bowel
this
case
likewise
emphasizes
the
need
to
consider
the
presence
of
other
fetal
anomalies
such
as
omphalocele
or
gastroschisis
when
the
usual
maneuvers
fail
to
relieve
shoulder
dystocia
