the
ability

components

the
terminal
complement
components
to
contribute
to
the

defense
against
infection
this
study
was
performed
to
determine
if
defective
activation
of

by
bacteria
contributes
to
the
pathogenesis
of
the
recurrent
pulmonary
infections
in
cystic

when
each
of
the
bacteria
was
incubated
in
the
serum
of

for
minutes
the

the

as
in

of
the
two
patients
with
chronic

based
on
the
results
of
the
present
study
it
is
unlikely
that
defective

of
