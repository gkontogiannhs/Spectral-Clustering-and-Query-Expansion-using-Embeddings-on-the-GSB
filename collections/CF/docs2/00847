properties
of
of
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
from
control
and
cystic

patients
were
studied
using
alpha
carbobenzoxy
glutamyl
tyrosine
as
substrate
was
inhibited
by
thiomersal
cyanide
iodoacetate
and
ethylmaleimide
in
similar
manner
for
control
and
cystic

fibroblasts
both
trypsin
and
dithiothreitol
treatment
activated
the
enzyme
but
phenanthroline
inhibited
only
in
the

of
dithiothreitol
both
zn
and
co
reversed
this
inhibition
trypsin

of

form
of
the
enzyme
having

for
both
control

cystic

fibroblasts
dithiothreitol
treatment
of
control
fibroblasts
resulted
in
form
with
similar
properties
to
the
trypsin
activated
form
but
cystic
fibrosis
fibroblasts
yielded
variant
form
with
even
higher
km
and
vmax
values
since
other
properties
were
similar
it
seems
likely
that
this
difference
reflected
binding
of

the

rather
than
of
defect
in
the
enzyme
