fertility
in
man
with
cystic
fibrosis
our
patient
had
well
compensated
and
late
appearing
cystic
fibrosis
manifested
by
moderately
decreased
exercise
tolerance
and
normal
semen
analysis
and
he
had
presumably
fathered
one
child
it
is
important
to
again
emphasize
the
physician
obligation
to
determine
fertility
in
any
male
cystic
fibrosis
patient
particularly
with
late
onset
of
symptoms
and
to
provide
appropriate
genetic
counseling
