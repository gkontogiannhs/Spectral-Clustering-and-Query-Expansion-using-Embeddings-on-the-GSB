continuous
distributions
of
specific
ventilation
recovered
from
inert
gas
washout
we
describe
new
technique
for
recovering
continuous
distributions
of
ventilation
as
function
of
tidal
ventilation
volume
ratio
from
the
nitrogen
washout
the
analysis
yields
continuous
distribution
of
as
function
of
represented
as
fractional
ventilations
of
compartments
plus
dead
space
the
procedure
was
verified
by
recovering
known
distributions
from
data
to
which
noise
had
been
added
using
an
apparatus
to
control
the
subject
tidal
volume
and
frc
mixed
expired
data
gave
the
following
results
the
distributions
of
young
normal
subjects
were
narrow
and
unimodal
with
mean
ln
standard
deviation
of
plus
or
minus
those
of
subjects
over
age
were
broader
ln
sd
plus
or
minus
with
more
poorly
ventilated
units
patients
with
pulmonary
disease
of
all
descriptions
showed
enlarged
dead
space
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
showed
multimodal
distributions
with
the
bulk
of
the
ventilation
going
to
overventilated
units
and
patients
with
obstructive
lung
diseases
fell
into
several
classes
three
of
which
are
illustrated
these
results
suggest
that
our
approach
is
well
suited
for
clinical
investigation
