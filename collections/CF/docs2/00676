the
occurrence
and
effects
of
human
vitamin
deficiency
study
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
role
of
vitamin
in
human
nutrition
was
studied
by
investigation
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
and
associated
pancreatic
insufficiency
vitamin
status
was
assessed
by
measurement
of
the
plasma
concentration
of
the
principal
circulating
isomer
alpha
tocopherol
results
of
such
determinations
in
cf
patients
with
pancreatogenic
steatorrhea
revealed
that
all
were
deficient
in
the
vitamin
the
extent
of
decreased
plasma
tocopherol
varied
markedly
but
correlated
with
indices
of
intestinal
malabsorption
such
as
the
serum
carotene
concentration
and
percentage
of
dietary
fat
absorbed
supplementation
with
times
the
recommended
daily
allowance
of
vitamin
in
water
miscible
form
increased
the
plasma
alpha
tocopherol
concentrations
to
normal
in
all
cf
patients
so
evaluated
studies
on
the
effects
of
vitamin
deficiency
focused
on
possible
hematologic
alterations
an
improved
technique
was
developed
to
measure
erythrocyte
hemolysis
in
vitro
in
the
presence
of
hydrogen
peroxide
while
erythrocyte
suspensions
from
control
subjects
demonstrated
resistance
to
hemolysis
during
incubation
all
samples
from
tocopherol
deficient
cf
patients
showed
abnormal
oxidant
susceptibility
evidenced
by
greater
than
hemoglobin
release
the
degree
of
peroxide
induced
hemolysis
was
related
to
the
plasma
alpha
tocopherol
concentrationin
an
inverse
sigmoidal
manner
the
possibility
of
in
vivo
hemolysis
was
assessed
by
measuring
the
survival
of
cr
labeled
erythrocytes
in
vitamin
deficient
patients
moderate
but
statistically
significant
decrease
in
the
mean
cr
erythrocyte
half
life
value
was
found
in
this
group
measurement
of
erythrocyte
survival
before
and
after
supplementation
of
patients
with
vitamin
demonstrated
that
the
shortened
erythrocyte
lifespan
could
be
corrected
to
normal
with
this
treatment
other
hematologic
indices
in
deficient
subjects
however
were
normal
and
did
not
change
upon
supplementation
with
vitamin
it
is
concluded
that
cf
is
invariably
associated
with
vitamin
deficiency
provided
that
the
patient
in
question
has
pancreatic
achylia
and
is
not
taking
supplementary
doses
of
tocopherol
concomitant
hematologic
effects
consistent
with
mild
hemolysis
but
not
anemia
occur
and
may
be
reversed
with
vitamin
therapy
patients
with
cf
should
be
given
daily
doses
of
water
miscible
form
of
vitamin
to
correct
the
deficiency
