azlocillin
securopen
was
given
in
doses
of
and
mg
kg
body
weight
to
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
after
intravenous
bolus
infections
the
serum
half
life
was
after
the
lower
dose
and
after
the
higher
dose
this
was
consequent
to
dose
limited
elimination
kinetics
due
to
limitation
in
both
renal
and
non
renal
processes
of
elimination
upon
doubling
of
the
dose
from
to
mg
kg
the
total
body
clearance
dropped
from
to
evaluation
of
data
presented
in
other
publications
indicate
that
dose
limited
elimination
kinetics
is
the
normal
situation
for
azlocillin
besides
the
serum
concentrations
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
were
considerably
lower
than
seen
in
the
healthy
state
the
reason
is
faster
elimination
by
the
renal
route
in
cystic
fibrosis
