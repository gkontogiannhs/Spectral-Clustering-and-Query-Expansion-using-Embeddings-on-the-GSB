white
cell
glutathione
reductase
in
cystic
fibrosis
we
have
reported
that
red
cell
glutathione
reductase
activity
is
increased
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
in
comparison
with
age
and
sex
matched
controls
we
have
also
demonstrated
that
serum
activity
is
significantly
greater
in
than
in
controls
obligate
heterozygotes
and
patients
with
variety
of
respiratory
and
immunological
diseases
moreover
serum
from
patients
and
carriers
responds
differently
from
controls
after
storage
or
incubation
with
heparin
we
have
now
examined
in
white
blood
cells
of
patients
the
day
after
collection
of
samples
mean
activity
was
significantly
less
in
the
group
than
in
carriers
and
controls
no
differences
in
activity
between
the
groups
was
apparent
after
and
days
white
cell
activity
apparently
is
lower
in
patients
than
in
controls
we
cannot
rationalise
this
decrease
with
the
increased
activity
found
in
red
cells
and
serum
nevertheless
the
differences
between
and
controls
are
of
greater
interest
than
the
apparent
directional
contradiction
the
basis
for
quantatitive
enzyme
differences
is
very
difficult
to
determine
the
simplest
explanation
is
that
the
initial
white
cell
differences
between
patients
on
the
one
hand
and
controls
and
carriers
on
the
other
are
secondary
to
some
aspect
of
the
disease
or
its
treatment
but
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
such
conclusion
these
results
which
reflect
altered
behaviour
of
from
patients
suggest
to
us
that
is
involved
in
