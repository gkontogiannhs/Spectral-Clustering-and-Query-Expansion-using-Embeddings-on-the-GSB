without
insulin
were
administered
separately
by
iontophoresis
to
patients
with

cf
obligate
heterozygotes

the
resultant
sweat

concentration
after
treatment
with
both
preparations
was
compared
in
each

no

after
the
two
treatments
was
found
in
the
control
sample
decrease
in
sweat

concentration
after
insulin
iontophoresis
in
comparison
with
the
vehicle
was
observed
in
both
the

these
observations
suggest
an

of
insulin
in
