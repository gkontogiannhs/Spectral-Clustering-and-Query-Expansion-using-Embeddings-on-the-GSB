considerations
on
new
method
for
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
have
an
increased
concentration
of
sodium
in
their
nails
hitherto
only
neutron
activation
analysis
has
been
considered
for
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
by
analysis
of
electrolytes
in
nails
it
has
been
thoroughly
tested
and
clinically
however
the
intrinsic
advantages
of
ray
microanalysis
and
the
results
obtained
in
this
study
suggest
that
this
method
after
further
testing
may
be
useful
diagnostic
acid
for
cystic
fibrosis
in
comparison
with
neutron
activation
analysis
ray
microanalysis
has
the
advantage
of
simultaneously
giving
the
concentrations
of
several
elements
and
may
be
accessible
at
any
hospital
with
an
electron
microscope
fitted
with
the
necessary
equipment
nails
of
cf
patients
are
here
shown
to
have
increased
concentrations
of
na
and
cl
which
will
make
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
more
reliable
the
possibility
of
using
sulphur
as
reference
element
may
eliminate
the
weighing
procedure
necessary
in
neutron

analysis
