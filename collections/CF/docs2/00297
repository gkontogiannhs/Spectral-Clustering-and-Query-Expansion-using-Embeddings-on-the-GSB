cystic
fibrosis
cf
is
generalized
disorder
of
the
exocrine
glands
inherited
as
recessive
genetic
trait
the
disease
was
more
fully
described
as
specific
entity
in
with
pathology
of
dilated
ducts
and
fibrotic
changes
in
the
pancreas
and
copious
secretory
intraluminal
obstruction
of
the
bronchial
tree
the
symptoms
predominately
involve
the
tract
as
more
frequent
bulky
malformed
and
malodorous
stools
and
the
respiratory
system
as
cough
wheezing
and
signs
of
chronic
respiratory
obstruction
in
certain
instances
only
one
of
these
two
systems
will
have
manifest
symptoms

discovered
in
the
elevated
salt
concentration
of
the

has
proven
to
be

diagnostic
tool
to
confirm
the

of

few
diseases
present
in
does
cf
all
present
treatments
for
cystic
fibrosis
are
essentially
symptomatic
since
the
study
of
families
having
child
with
cystic

has
shown
an
incidence
of
the
disease
in
one
fourth
of
their

classification
of
the

as
an
autosomal

genetic
disorder
suggests
that
the
concept
of
an
abnormal

alteration
in
single

should
apply
the

in

and
his
