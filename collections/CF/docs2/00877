should
we
screen
all
newborns
for
cystic
fibrosis
to
assess
the
value
of
detecting
albumin
in
meconium
as
screening
procedure
for
cystic
fibrosis
cf
meconium
samples
were
examined
by
bm
meconium
test
single
radial
immunodiffusion
and
benzidine
reaction
the
specificity
and
sensitivity
of
this
combination
of
tests
were
and
respectively
the
prevalence
of
cf
at
birth
was
confirmed
as
in
this
country
this
low
prevalence
resulted
in
relatively
high
number
of
false
positives
therefore
positive
test
result
has
low
predictive
value
and
this
is
serious
drawback
of
the
method
the
experiences
and
opinions
of
local
paediatricians
about
the
screening
programme
were
evaluated
by
simple
questionnaire
gold
decision
rule
was
applied
the
least
relative
cost
of
justifying
mass
screening
programme
was
times
higher
than
the
actual
relative
cost
as
suggested
by
the
aggregate
opinion
of
paediatricians
in
the
region
these
results
support
the
view
that
with
the
methods
used
screening
may
have
more
disadvantages
than
not
screening
