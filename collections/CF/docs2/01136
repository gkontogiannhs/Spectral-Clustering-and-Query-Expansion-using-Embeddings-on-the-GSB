reactive
proteases
in
amniotic
fluid
possible
marker
for
cystic
fibrosis
letter
previous
studies
in
our
laboratory
have
demonstrated
significant
differences
in
the
extent
of
protease
reactivity
with
mugb
sensitive
active
site
titrant
of
many
serine
proteases
when
plasma
and
cultivated
skin
fibroblasts
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
obligate
heterozygotes
and
controls
were
compared
because
of
these
observations
and
the
potential
value
of
amniotic
fluid
for
the
prenatal
detection
of
cystic
fibrosis
these
studies
were
extended
to
human
amniotic
fluid
obtained
by
amniocentesis
done
for
the
intrauterine
detection
of
genetic
and
other
fetal
abnormalities
an
amniotic
fluid
sample
obtained
from
woman
who
was
subsequently
delivered
of
baby
with
cf
showed
much
reduced
level
of
mugb
reactivity
similar
to
the
relative
deficiency
observed
in
plasma
and
cultivated
skin
fibroblasts
from
patients
with
cf
these
observations
suggest
that
amniotic
fluid
protease
activity
may
be
useful
marker
for
the
prenatal
detection
of
cf
