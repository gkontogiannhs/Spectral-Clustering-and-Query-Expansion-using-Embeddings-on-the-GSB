intussusception
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
year
old
boy
with
cystic
fibrosis
had
intermittent
episodes
of
abdominal
pain
probably
due
to
recurrent
this
type
of
bowel
obstruction
is
probably
more
frequent
in
patients
with
fibrocystic
disease
thick
vascid
inspissated
feces
appears
to
be
the
cause
of
the
prevention
of
the
inspissation
may
reduce
the
incidence
of
these
obstructions
the
treatment
for
this
problem
is
the
same
as
in
other
noncystic
patients
