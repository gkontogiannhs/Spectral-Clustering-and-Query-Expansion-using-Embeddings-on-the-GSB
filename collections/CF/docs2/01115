cystic
fibrosis
and
malnutrition
cystic
fibrosis
as
specific
disease
entity
has
been
known
to
be
associated
with
malnutrition
for
almost
half
century
the
importance
of
the
malnutrition
in
the
disease
process
remains
unknown
as
does
much
information
about
specific
nutritional
deficiencies
in
cf
supplements
for
children
with
cf
should
include
extra
energy
as
fat
or
carbohydrate
form
of
linoleic
acid
that
can
be
absorbed
hydrolyzed
protein
fat
soluble
vitamins
with
vitamins
and
in
water
emulsion
vitamin
probably
vitamins
and
vitamin
and
trace
minerals
routine
measurements
of
nutritional
status
particularly
in
children
with
growth
failure
should
be
made
at
regular
intervals
and
should
include
three
day
diet
record
and
simultaneous
hour
stool
fat
determination
if
fat
malabsorption
is
not
controlled
by
pancreatic
enzymes
the
use
of
antacids
or
cimetidine
should
be
considered
the
true
role
of
nutrition
in
patients
with
cf
will
not
be
known
until
the
appropriate
studies
are
completed
