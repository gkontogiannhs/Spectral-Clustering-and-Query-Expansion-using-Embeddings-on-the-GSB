letter
as
far
as
know
no
test
for
the
prenatal
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
has
yet
been
shown
to
be
reliable
but
several
experimental
studies
on
prenatal
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
are
being
carried
out
deficient
protease
activity
assayed
by
an
active
site
titrant
of
serine
proteases
has
been
reported
in
plasma
and
cultivated
skin
fibroblasts
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
another
prenatal
diagnostic
test
for
cystic
fibrosis
involves
the
observed
resistance
of
patients
skin
fibroblasts
to
dexamethasone
synthetic
glucocorticoid
toxicity
in
comparison
to
normal
fibroblasts
specific
induction
of
alkaline
phosphatase
with
tamm
horsfall
glycoprotein
isoproterenol
and
theophylline
has
been
recorded
in

fibroblasts
from
