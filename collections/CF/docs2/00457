infections
in

amantadine
hc
an
antiviral
drug
clinically
effective
against
most
strains
of
influenza
virus
was
evaluated
in
double
blind
trial
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
during
the
initial
appearance
of
influenza
england
virus
in
the
new
england
area
infection
with
this
variant
strain
of
influenza
virus
did
not
reach
epidemic
proportions
during
the
study
so
that
the
effectiveness
of
amantadine
in
this
study
population
could
not
be
fully
assessed
however
the
potential
symptomatic
and
biochemical
toxicity
of
amantadine
was
carefully
monitored
in
pediatric
population
serologic
screening
by
complement
fixation
tests
indicated
that
respiratory
viruses
may
be
important
pathogens
in
exacerbations
of
respiratory
disease
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
