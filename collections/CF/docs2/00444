factors
related
to
cystic
fibrosis
pp
variety
of
bioassays
have
identified
molecules
circulating
in
cystic
fibrosis
genotypes
and
synthesized
in
vitro
by
cultured
cells
from
these
genotypes
by
functional
disturbances
observed
in
the
assays
employed
preliminary
of
these
factors
are
in
general
agreement
and
the
properties
include
small
molecular
weight
polypeptide
within
the
range
of
to
mw
heat
labile
protein
having
cationic
charge
and
protein
present
in
saliva
serum
urine
and
perhaps
sweat
which
is
synthesized
in
vitro
by
fibroblasts
short
term
lymphocytes
and
long
term
lymphoid
lines
the
relationship
of
the
factor
or
factors
to
the
pathogenesis
of
cystic
fibrosis
is
presently
unknown
but
its
presence
in
cystic
fibrosis
genotypes
appears
to
be
related
to
the
basic
defect
