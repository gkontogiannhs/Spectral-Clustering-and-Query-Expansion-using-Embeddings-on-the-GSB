in

from
normal
persons

cystic

patients
determined
by
means
of
crossed
serum
from
normal
persons
and
from

patients
was
examined
for
precipitins
against

against

by
means
of
crossed
of
the
normal
sera
contained
precipitins
against

contained
one
precipitin
against
fragilis
and
contained
one
precipitin
against

in
sera
from
cystic

patients
there
was
significantly
increased
prevalence
of
precipitins
against

fragilis
and
aeruginosa
and
the
mean
number
of
precipitins
against
each
of
these
bacteria
was
range
range
and
range
respectively
increased
numbers
of
precipitins
against
aeruginosa
were
correlated
with
chronic
lung
infection
caused
by
this
species
and
with
poor
prognosis
whereas
such
associations
were
not
revealed
as
regards
precipitins
against
the
two
other
bacterial
species
increased
numbers
of
precipitins
against
coli
and
fragilis
were
significantly
associated
with
increased
numbers
of
precipitins
against
aeruginosa
it
is
suggested
that
this
association
is
due
to
immune
reactions
in
the
intestinal
mucosa
resulting
in
increased
absorption
of
antigens
from
the
gut
