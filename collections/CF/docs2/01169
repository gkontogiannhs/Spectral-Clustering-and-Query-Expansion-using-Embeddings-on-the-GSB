bronchial
provocation
tests
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
have
higher
incidence
of
positive
skin
prick
tests
than
normal
this
may
be
the
result
of
defective
antigen
handling
at
mucosal
surfaces
our
aim
was
to
investigate
bronchial
allergy
in
group
of
children
with
cf
and
positive
skin
tests
we
studied
children
aged
to
years
with
mild
to
moderate
respiratory
disease
only
child
gave
history
of
wheezing
not
associated
with
chest
infections
and
this
study
supports
the
hypothesis
that
clinical
asthma
is
product
of
bronchial
allergy
and
broncholability
the
responses
to
bronchial
provocation
with
aspergillus
suggest
that
allergy
to
this
antigen
may
play
part
in
the
pathogenesis
of
lung
disease
in
some
patients
with
cf
