cystic

lability
in
survey
of
cystic
fibrosis
cf
in
the
avon
area
children
with
cf
from
families
together
with
of
their
parents
were
studied
by
spirometry
exercise
tests
and
pinch
tests
control
group
of
young
adults
was
similarly
tested
control
data
for
children
were
taken
from
previously
published
work
the
prevalence
of
atopy
any
positive
prick
test
in
children
with
cf
was
sensitivity
to
grass
pollens
and
house
dust
mite
was
no
more
common
in
these
children
than
in
normal
population
to
aspergillus
fumigatus
was
found
in
of
children
with
cf
and
was
associated
with
severe
lung
disease
the
parents
had
normal
pattern
and
prevalence
of
atopy
exercise
induced
airways
obstruction
was
present
in
only
of
children
with
cf
its
association
with
severe
lung
disease
rendered
interpretation
difficult
the
parents
had
normal
response
to
exercise
both
to
fumigatus
and
exercise
induced
airways
lability
had
the
features
of
acquired
characteristics
there
was
nothing
in
the
present
study
to
support
the
hypothesis
that
the
possession
of

gene
predisposed
to
atopy
