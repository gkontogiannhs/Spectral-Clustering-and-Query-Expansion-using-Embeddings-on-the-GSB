assessment
of
cor
pulmonale
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
early
clinical
recognition
and
assessment
of
cor
pulmonale
are
frequently
difficult
to
evaluate
the
usefulness
of
measurement
of
right
ventricular
dimension
and
septal
motion
in
assessing
cor
pulmonale
we
studied
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
of
varying
severity
there
was
significant
relationship
between
increasing
right
ventricular
dimension
index
rvdi
and
decreasing
clinical
score
vital
capacity
forced
expiratory
volume
in
one
second
fev
and
maximal
midexpiratory
flow
rate
mmfr
and
increasing
residual
volume
and
thoracic
gas
volume
there
was
no
correlation
between
right
ventricular
dimension
index
and
pao
these
findings
were
supported
by
and
pathologic
evidence
of
right
ventricular
involvement
abnormal
septal
motion
was
observed
more
frequently
in
patients
with
severe
obstructive
airway
disease
as
measured
by
decreased
vital
capacity
fev
and
mmfr
the
data
show
that
there
is
evidence
of
mild
right
ventricular
enlargement
and
or
hypertrophy
much
earlier
in
the
course
of
cystic
fibrosis
than
previously
suspected
and
that
the
echocardiogram
is
useful
tool
in
the
evaluation
of
cor
pulmonale
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
