immunological
studies
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
concentrations
of
immunoglobulins
were
determined
using
mancini
method
and
who
standard
in
sera
taken
during
long
term
treatment
of
children
with
from
months
to
years
old
they
were
shown
to
depend
markedly
on
the
clinical
state
of
the
children
particularly
on
the
presence
of
pulmonary
tract
infectious
processes
these
infections
caused
rise
in
immunoglobulin
concentration
with
predominance
of
igm
in
children
aged
up
to
yrs
and
with
predominance
of
igg
in
older
children
mean
titer
of
in
children
with
was
higher
than
in
healthy
children
low
titers
of
diphtherial
and
stapholococcal
antibodies
were
found
in
the
case
of
anti
diphtheria
antibodies
this
can
be
attributed
to
the
fact
that
these
children
are
not
regularly
vaccinated
owing
to
their
poor
clinical
condition
as
to
the
low
titer
of
antibodies
this
is
well
known
finding
in
the
course
of
chronic
staphylococcal
infections
of
appropriate
bacteriological
tests
in
our
children
furthermore
their
lymphocytes
showed
an
increased
blastic
transformation
when
stimulated
with
staphylococcal

transformation
of
pha
stimulated
lymphocytes
was
normal
