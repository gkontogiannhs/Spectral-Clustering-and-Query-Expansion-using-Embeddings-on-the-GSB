tropomyosin
antibody
the
specific
localization
of
tropomyosin
in
nonmuscle
cells
an
antibody
against
purified
chicken
skeletal
muscle
tropomyosin
is
used
in
indirect
to
visualize
the
localization
of
tropomyosin
in
variety
of
nonmuscle
cells
the
antibody
produces
fluorescent
pattern
which
is
very
similar
to
that
obtained
with
an
actin
specific
antibody
this
pattern
is
composed
of
fluorescent
fibers
which
are
shown
to
be
coincident
with
the
fibers
seen
with
phase
contrast
optics
high
resolution
epifluorescent
microscopy
reveals
that
fibers
stained
with
the
actin
antibody
show
continuous
fluorescence
while
fibers
reacted
with
the
tropomyosin
antibody
show
periodic
fluorescence
measurements
indicate
that
the
lengths
of
the
fluorescent
segments
are
variable
with
an
average
of
mum
while
the
spacing
between
segments
is
approximately
mum
