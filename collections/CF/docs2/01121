showed
that
the
raised
na
concentration
in
the
sweat
of
children
suffering
from
cystic
fibrosis
was
due
to
defect
in
na
reabsorption
in
the
duct
epithelium
but
somewhat
surprisingly
the
transepithelial
potential
difference
is
the
same
as
that
in
normal
controls
na
transport
is
also
reduced
in
the
chronically

of

because

the

we
would
like
to
report

taken
at

there

the

appeared
to
have
increased

there
was
