the
impact
of
the
death
of
cystic
fibrosis
child
on
subsequent
family
function
was
evaluated
in
retrospective
study
of
families
in
findings
similar
to
that
reported
for
another
model
of
fatal
childhood
illness
leukemia
there
was
high
incidence
of
emotional
and
medical
problems
in
the
parents
there
was
an
unexpectedly
high
incidence
of
incomplete
mourning
maintenance
of
the
child
room
as
shrine
or
weekly
grave
visit
for
more
than
six
months
siblings
had
less
difficulty
in
adjusting
to
the
loss
than
that
reported
for
the
siblings
of
leukemic
children
it
is
suggested
that
the
prolonged
course
of
disease
with
hopeless
prognosis
prepares
the
family
for
the
child
death
but
also
retards
the
mourning
process
the
family
may
need
counseling
to
ensure
that
mourning
is
completed
