essential
fatty
acids
in
cystic
fibrosis
in
three
literature
reports
the
linoleic
acid
levels
for
cystic
fibrosis
compared
to
controls
are
always
more
significantly
lower
than
arachidonic
acid
similarly
the
percentage
lowering
is
also
more
for
than
there
is
thus
no
overwhelming
evidence
for
blocked
or
absent
desaturase
and
the
cause
of
the
deficiency
must
be
elsewhere
we
have
found
up
to
of
the
total
fatty
acids
in
both
serum
and
red
cells
to
be
omega
all
of
our
patients
have
shown
this
acid
at
some
stage
and
for
most
it
is
permanent
feature
of
their
fatty
acid
profile
it
has
been
reported
that
omega
would
probably
act
as
an
inhibitor
of
prostaglandin
formation
from
and
it
is
interesting
to
conjecture
on
whether
this
could
account
for
some
of
the
symptoms
of
omega
would
also
be
incorporated
into
and
could
then
alter
membrane
properties
