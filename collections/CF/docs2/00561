fibroblasts
the
capacity
of
skin
fibroblasts
from
cystic
fibrosis
cf
and
non
cf
individuals
to
incorporate
exogenous
fucose
into
various
metabolic
pools
was
compared
incorporation
into
intracellular
acid
soluble
pools
and
extracellular
glycopeptides
was
measured
by
dual
label
co
chromatographic
technique
whereas
total
macromolecular
incorporation
was
measured
by
single
label
procedure
although
cf
and
normal
fibroblasts
incorporate
exogenous
fucose
into
intracellular
acid
soluble
and
high
molecular
weight
compounds
in
similar
manner
cf
cells
appear
to
be
characterized
by
an
increased
incorporation
of

into
low
