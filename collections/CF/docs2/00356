in
homozygous

subjects
total
amylase
activity
of
serum
and
mixed
saliva
was
studied
in
homozygotes
and
heterozygotes
for
mucoviscidosis
and
in
healthy
subjects
mean
serum
total
activity
was
in
the
homozygotes
exceeding
in
nearly
of
the
cases
the
values
given
in
the
literature
and
those
observed
in
the
normal
controls
the
difference
against
the
control
group
was
significant
less
than
mean
serum
total
amylase
activity
of
heterozygotes
agreed
with
the
mean
value
for
the
healthy
group
without
significant
difference
total
amylase
activity
in
the
saliva
of
homozygotes
was
higher
than
in
the
heterozygotes
of
the
healthy
children
the
difference
between
the
homozygous
and
healthy
groups
was
strongly
significant
less
than
and
that
between
the
heterozygous
group
and
the
combined
healthy
children
and
adult
groups
was
also
significant
less
than
in
the
heterozygotes
salivary
amylase
activity
was
slightly
elevated
but
not
significantly
different
from
the
control
group
and
did
not
result
in
