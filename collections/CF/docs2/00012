et
al
reported
case
of
year
old
boy
with
the
russell
variant
of
the
silver
russell
syndrome
concomitant
with
cystic
fibrosis
we
would
like
to
describe
another
patient
who
had
the
same
combination
of
diseases
the
pattern
of
clinical
findings
in
this
patient
are
in
accordance
with
that
of
the
silver
russell
syndrome
it
is
of
course
possible
that
the
development
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
this
patient
is
entirely
accidental
although
such
coincidence
would
be
statistically
rare
event
the
establishment
of
possible
relationship
between
these
two
conditions
would
depend
on
reports
of
other
similar
cases
